Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) UI
A Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) dashboard built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JSON Server. This application serves as a user-friendly interface for managing users, roles, and permissions efficiently. It demonstrates how to build a scalable CRUD-based system while implementing foundational principles of RBAC for secure and organized data handling.

The primary goal of this project is to showcase how an intuitive interface can simplify the management of users, roles, and permissions. Designed with flexibility in mind, this dashboard can serve as a starting point for developing more advanced role-based systems for enterprises or real-world applications.
User Management:
Add Users:
Admins can easily add new users by entering basic information. Each addition updates the backend in real time.
Edit Users:
Modify user details dynamically via the dashboard. All changes are updated in the backend seamlessly.
Delete Users:
Remove users from the system with a confirmation prompt for safe actions.
Dynamic User Display:
User data is fetched dynamically from the backend and displayed on the dashboard.
Role Management:
Define Roles:
Add and edit roles with clear attributes like "Admin," "Editor," or "Viewer."
Assign Roles to Users:
Map specific roles to users and manage their permissions efficiently.
Permission Management:
Modify Permissions:
Assign or update permissions (e.g., Read, Write, Delete) for roles dynamically.
Custom Attributes:
Configure additional permissions or attributes for fine-grained control.
Dynamic API Simulation (Optional):
Use JSON Server to simulate CRUD operations and validate UI functionality.
Responsive Design:
The dashboard offers a seamless experience across all devices with an adaptive interface.
Technologies Used
Frontend:
HTML: Structure and layout of the dashboard.
CSS: Styling to create a professional and user-friendly interface.
JavaScript: Handles logic for CRUD operations and data interactions.
Backend:
JSON Server: Simulates a RESTful API for data management.
